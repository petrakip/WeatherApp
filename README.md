# 🌦 WeatherApp

A modern **React + Vite weather application** that allows users to search for cities and view current weather conditions using the **OpenWeather API**.

The application provides a clean user interface and includes features such as **favorites, search history, offline caching**, and **dynamic UI themes based on weather conditions**.

The project demonstrates practical usage of:

- React component architecture
- API integration
- localStorage persistence
- offline-first design patterns

## 🔑 Environment Variables

This project requires an **OpenWeather API key**.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
Add the following variable:
```bash
VITE_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here

## 💾 Local Storage Usage

The application uses **localStorage** to improve user experience and provide offline functionality.

Stored data includes:

| Key | Description |
|----|----|
| wx_history_v1 | Stores the user's search history |
| wx_favorites_v1 | Stores favorite cities |
| wx_cache_v1:* | Cached weather data per city |
| wx_last_v1 | Last displayed weather data |

This allows the application to restore previously viewed data and operate in **offline mode** when possible.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Possible enhancements for future development:

- 5-day weather forecast
- Automatic location detection
- Temperature unit toggle (°C / °F)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support
- Weather maps integration

## 📄 License
